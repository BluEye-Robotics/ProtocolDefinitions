# ProtocolDefinitions
This repository contains protocol definitions for interacting with the Blueye Pioneer.

See [blueye.protocol](https://github.com/BluEye-Robotics/blueye.protocol) and
[blueye.sdk](https://github.com/BluEye-Robotics/blueye.sdk) for Python libraries that
are built on these definitions and simplifies their use.
